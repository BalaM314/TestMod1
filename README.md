## Test Mod 1
A dead meme mod, made by BalaM314.
Will add totally random and semi-useless features as I learn modding.

Adds the following
# Items:
Thingy: A simple item with the texture of Elon Musk's face upside down.
Token item: gives you ridiculous speed and puts you in creative mode on right-clicking a block
Meme: An item with the texture of the Stick Bugged meme. Breaks most blocks on right-click, or gives you status effects on special blocks.

# Blocks:
Thomas: A block with miscellaneous random textures. It has negative friction and 420.0 jump boost height, so beware.
Rickroll: A block that looks like the Thomas, but can be activated by right-clicking it with a Meme. Falling on it from more than 10 blocks causes a rickrolling incident.
Also its only flammable on the bottom side and if it ignites it goes kaboom.
